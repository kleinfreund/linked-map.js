# linked-map.js

A reverse-iterable, linked map implementation for JavaScript.

## Why?

Part of the additions to ECMAScript 2015 are the [iteration protocols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols): [Iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) and [iterator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterator_protocol). The former allows arbitrary objects to become iterable. Following the rules of the protocol gives one iteration capabilities via the following techniques:

* [`for...of` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)
* [`Array.from()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from)
* [Spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)

**However**, only the iteration in one direction is considered by the [specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-iteration) at the time. This means that we only get forward-iteration by default.

Now, with the iteration protocols, we could redefine the iteration behavior for our purpose and make an objects backwards-iterable. Unfortunately, this also means losing forwards-iterability.

**If you need both a forwards- and backwards-iterable object, this implementation might be for you.**

## But why a map?

Thatâ€™s what I needed. To be precise, I needed to access an iterator _at a specific location_ in my data structure and be able to _iterate in both directions_.

I tried my best to stick to the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) interface as close as possible.
